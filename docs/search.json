    "text": "Covariate-Adjusted Treatment Effects for Recurrent Events with Terminal Outcomes\n\nCovariate-Adjusted Treatment Effects for Recurrent Events with Terminal Outcomes\nAffiliation: Arnold School of Public Health | Oct 2025 – Present\nKeywords: Recurrent events; terminal events; causal inference; covariate adjustment; clinical trials; survival analysis\n\nFoundational work:\nSun, J., Ye, T., et al.\nImprove the Precision of Area Under Curve Estimation for Recurrent Events Through Covariate Adjustment\nhttps://arxiv.org/html/2410.24163v3\n\n\n\nTo develop an estimand-driven, covariate-adjusted causal framework for treatment effects on recurrent clinical outcomes when a terminal event (e.g., death) may change survival and, as a consequence, the amount of time recurrent outcomes are observable. \n\n\n\nRecurrent event endpoints are common in clinical trials, including adverse events, hospitalizations, and disease flares. When a terminal event occurs, standard summaries of recurrent outcomes can be difficult to interpret because treatment can affect both (i) the recurrence process and (ii) survival time.\nRecent work by Sun and Ye et al. developed covariate-adjusted inference for an AUC of the mean cumulative function (MCF) estimand. Their estimand can be written (schematically) as an AUC functional of an MCF that depends on both the recurrent event rate and survival. As a result, when treatment affects survival, the estimand can change even if the underlying recurrent event rate does not, complicating scientific interpretation in settings where the goal is to isolate recurrence effects. \n\n\n\nThis project extends the Sun–Cook line of work by refining the causal estimand and developing an estimator that targets recurrence effects in a way that is orthogonal to survival differences. The goal is an estimand whose treatment contrast is zero when treatment affects survival only (but not recurrence), and nonzero only when treatment changes recurrence dynamics.\nKey contributions: - A survival-orthogonal recurrence-burden estimand that removes survival-weighting from the target, improving interpretability when survival differs by arm. - An orthogonal, influence-function–based estimator enabling: - valid covariate-adjusted inference,\n- robustness to nuisance-model misspecification,\n- improved precision under randomized trials. - A causal framing aligned with modern estimand principles for intercurrent events in clinical trials. \n\n\n\nSimulations were conducted under three mechanisms:\n\nNo treatment effect on survival\n\nTreatment benefit on survival\n\nTreatment harm on survival\n\nAcross scenarios, we compared:\n\nthe proposed orthogonal estimator, and\n\nestimators corresponding to standard MCF/AUC-based summaries from prior literature.\n\nPerformance metrics included bias, variance, and power under covariate adjustment. \n\n\n\nLet \\(N_i(t)\\) denote the counting process for recurrent events up to time \\(t\\) for subject \\(i\\), and let \\(D_i\\) denote the terminal event time (e.g., death). Let \\(C_i\\) denote administrative censoring and \\(T_i=\\min(D_i,C_i)\\), with at-risk indicator \\(Y_i(t)=I(T_i\\ge t)\\). Let \\(A_i\\in\\{0,1\\}\\) denote treatment assignment.\nA common summary for recurrent events is the mean cumulative function (MCF): \\[\n\\mu_a(t)=\\mathbb{E}\\{N_i(t)\\mid A_i=a\\},\n\\] which averages recurrent event counts over all individuals. In the presence of a terminal event, MCF-based AUC summaries typically incorporate survival, so treatment effects on survival can influence the estimand even when recurrence dynamics are unchanged.\n\n\nDefine the marginal cumulative recurrence rate (Nelson–Aalen type target) \\[\nR_a(t)=\\int_0^t \\mathbb{E}\\{\\lambda_a(u\\mid X)\\}\\,du,\n\\] where \\(\\lambda_a(u\\mid X)\\) is the recurrent event intensity among those at risk under treatment \\(a\\).\nWe define the orthogonal recurrence-burden AUC \\[\n\\widetilde U_a(\\tau)=\\int_0^\\tau R_a(t)\\,dt\n=\\int_0^\\tau (\\tau-u)\\,dR_a(u),\n\\] and the treatment contrast \\[\n\\Delta_{\\text{orth}}(\\tau)=\\log\\left\\{\\frac{\\widetilde U_1(\\tau)}{\\widetilde U_0(\\tau)}\\right\\}.\n\\]\nKey property (survival orthogonality): if \\(dR_1(u)=dR_0(u)\\) for all \\(u\\le\\tau\\), then \\(\\widetilde U_1(\\tau)=\\widetilde U_0(\\tau)\\) and \\(\\Delta_{\\text{orth}}(\\tau)=0\\), even when survival differs by arm. This isolates recurrence effects from survival effects and yields a clearer clinical interpretation. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe orthogonal estimator closely tracks the true recurrence effect across regimes, while standard AUC-based estimators deviate when survival differs by treatment arm.\n \n##### Bias Induced by Survival Effects\nWhen survival is treatment-dependent, MCF/AUC-based estimators can exhibit systematic bias relative to a pure recurrence target. The orthogonal estimand substantially reduces this bias.\n \n\n\n\nAfter covariate adjustment, the orthogonal estimator maintains competitive or improved power without inflating type I error.\n \n\n\n\n\nThis framework supports clearer interpretation of repeated clinical outcomes in the presence of death or permanent discontinuation, with direct relevance to: - safety endpoints,\n- recurrent hospitalizations,\n- chronic disease flares,\n- oncology and neurodegenerative trials. \n\n\n\n\nMethodological development complete\n\nSimulation study ongoing\n\nManuscript in preparation"

    "text": "Covariate-Adjusted Treatment Effects for Recurrent Events with Terminal Outcomes\n\nCovariate-Adjusted Treatment Effects for Recurrent Events with Terminal Outcomes\nAffiliation: Arnold School of Public Health | Oct 2025 – Present\nKeywords: Recurrent events; terminal events; causal inference; covariate adjustment; clinical trials; survival analysis\n\nFoundational work:\nSun, J., Ye, T., et al.\nImprove the Precision of Area Under Curve Estimation for Recurrent Events Through Covariate Adjustment\nhttps://arxiv.org/html/2410.24163v3\n\n\n\nTo develop an estimand-driven, covariate-adjusted causal framework for treatment effects on recurrent clinical outcomes when a terminal event (e.g., death) may change survival and, as a consequence, the amount of time recurrent outcomes are observable. \n\n\n\nRecurrent event endpoints are common in clinical trials, including adverse events, hospitalizations, and disease flares. When a terminal event occurs, standard summaries of recurrent outcomes can be difficult to interpret because treatment can affect both (i) the recurrence process and (ii) survival time.\nRecent work by Sun and Ye et al. developed covariate-adjusted inference for an AUC of the mean cumulative function (MCF) estimand. Their estimand can be written (schematically) as an AUC functional of an MCF that depends on both the recurrent event rate and survival. As a result, when treatment affects survival, the estimand can change even if the underlying recurrent event rate does not, complicating scientific interpretation in settings where the goal is to isolate recurrence effects. \n\n\n\nThis project extends the Sun–Cook line of work by refining the causal estimand and developing an estimator that targets recurrence effects in a way that is orthogonal to survival differences. The goal is an estimand whose treatment contrast is zero when treatment affects survival only (but not recurrence), and nonzero only when treatment changes recurrence dynamics.\nKey contributions: - A survival-orthogonal recurrence-burden estimand that removes survival-weighting from the target, improving interpretability when survival differs by arm. - An orthogonal, influence-function–based estimator enabling: - valid covariate-adjusted inference,\n- robustness to nuisance-model misspecification,\n- improved precision under randomized trials. - A causal framing aligned with modern estimand principles for intercurrent events in clinical trials. \n\n\n\nSimulations were conducted under three mechanisms:\n\nNo treatment effect on survival\n\nTreatment benefit on survival\n\nTreatment harm on survival\n\nAcross scenarios, we compared:\n\nthe proposed orthogonal estimator, and\n\nestimators corresponding to standard MCF/AUC-based summaries from prior literature.\n\nPerformance metrics included bias, variance, and power under covariate adjustment. \n\n\n\nLet \\(N_i(t)\\) denote the counting process for recurrent events up to time \\(t\\) for subject \\(i\\), and let \\(D_i\\) denote the terminal event time (e.g., death). Let \\(C_i\\) denote administrative censoring and \\(T_i=\\min(D_i,C_i)\\), with at-risk indicator \\(Y_i(t)=I(T_i\\ge t)\\). Let \\(A_i\\in\\{0,1\\}\\) denote treatment assignment.\nA common summary for recurrent events is the mean cumulative function (MCF): \\[\n\\mu_a(t)=\\mathbb{E}\\{N_i(t)\\mid A_i=a\\},\n\\] which averages recurrent event counts over all individuals. In the presence of a terminal event, MCF-based AUC summaries typically incorporate survival, so treatment effects on survival can influence the estimand even when recurrence dynamics are unchanged.\n\n\nDefine the marginal cumulative recurrence rate (Nelson–Aalen type target) \\[\nR_a(t)=\\int_0^t \\mathbb{E}\\{\\lambda_a(u\\mid X)\\}\\,du,\n\\] where \\(\\lambda_a(u\\mid X)\\) is the recurrent event intensity among those at risk under treatment \\(a\\).\nWe define the orthogonal recurrence-burden AUC \\[\n\\widetilde U_a(\\tau)=\\int_0^\\tau R_a(t)\\,dt\n=\\int_0^\\tau (\\tau-u)\\,dR_a(u),\n\\] and the treatment contrast \\[\n\\Delta_{\\text{orth}}(\\tau)=\\log\\left\\{\\frac{\\widetilde U_1(\\tau)}{\\widetilde U_0(\\tau)}\\right\\}.\n\\]\nKey property (survival orthogonality): if \\(dR_1(u)=dR_0(u)\\) for all \\(u\\le\\tau\\), then \\(\\widetilde U_1(\\tau)=\\widetilde U_0(\\tau)\\) and \\(\\Delta_{\\text{orth}}(\\tau)=0\\), even when survival differs by arm. This isolates recurrence effects from survival effects and yields a clearer clinical interpretation. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe orthogonal estimator closely tracks the true recurrence effect across regimes, while standard AUC-based estimators deviate when survival differs by treatment arm.\n \n##### Bias Induced by Survival Effects\nWhen survival is treatment-dependent, MCF/AUC-based estimators can exhibit systematic bias relative to a pure recurrence target. The orthogonal estimand substantially reduces this bias.\n \n\n\n\nAfter covariate adjustment, the orthogonal estimator maintains competitive or improved power without inflating type I error.\n \n\n\n\n\nThis framework supports clearer interpretation of repeated clinical outcomes in the presence of death or permanent discontinuation, with direct relevance to: - safety endpoints,\n- recurrent hospitalizations,\n- chronic disease flares,\n- oncology and neurodegenerative trials. \n\n\n\n\nMethodological development complete\n\nSimulation study ongoing\n\nManuscript in preparation"
