The interaction effects revealed that treatment effectiveness varied significantly across subgroups, notably IDU and smoking status. CD4 improvement trajectories declined over time for all regimens, with Monotherapy and Triple therapy showing slower decline rates. These findings emphasize the importance of personalized HAART strategies based on behavioral and clinical profiles.\n\n\n\n2.

LME and GEE yielded comparable estimates at larger sample sizes, but diverged under smaller or unbalanced conditions. Interaction terms such as HAART √ó IDU and HAART √ó smoking status significantly influenced CD4 trajectories. Results guide model choice in HIV studies based on data characteristics, with GLMM preferred when flexibility and subject-level effects are key.\n\n\n\nSAS-Based Risk Modeling\nAffiliation: Volunteer Research Assistant, Western Michigan University | Aug 2024 ‚Äì Present\nDataset: Clinical trial and epidemiological datasets on lung cancer and age-related illness\nPurpose: To explore risk factor modeling and the effect of censoring in survival studies\nMethods:\n- Survival analysis using SAS\n- Cox models and regression diagnostics\nResult: Supported methodological development for censoring-adjusted survival estimation.

Despite convergence issues with sparse placebo response under PASI75, results were validated via PASI50 with placebo as reference. Findings support the advancement of 140mg and 210mg doses for Phase III trials. Simulated dropout patterns mirror real-world early-phase attrition, enhancing decision utility."

APOE4 status and centiloid level showed consistent association with AD progression across subgroups."
