*Biopharmaceutical Research Project: Dose-Finding and Missing Data Analysis in Psoriasis Trial*  

**Affiliation**: Biopharmaceutical Summer Academy, University of Connecticut | Jul 2025 – Aug 2025  
**Dataset**: Simulated Phase II Trial Data for Uconnemab (Psoriasis Therapy)  
**Purpose**: To determine optimal dosing and evaluate the robustness of early efficacy signals under clinically realistic dropout scenarios  
**Methods**:  
- Logistic regression modeling on PASI75 (primary) and PASI50 (validation) endpoints  
- Simulated missingness mechanisms: MCAR, MAR (response-based), MNAR (toxicity-index based)  
- Sensitivity analyses via complete-case analysis and non-responder imputation  

**Result**: Across all modeling strategies, the 140mg and 210mg doses consistently demonstrated superior clinical efficacy. Despite convergence issues with sparse placebo response under PASI75, results were validated via PASI50 with placebo as reference. Findings support the advancement of 140mg and 210mg doses for Phase III trials. Simulated dropout patterns mirror real-world early-phase attrition, enhancing decision utility.

 *Estimating Individualized Treatment Effects in Advanced Prostate Cancer: A Causal-Survival Modeling Approach to Risk-Guided Therapy* 
 
**Affiliation**: Western Michigan University | April 2025 – *Present*  

**Dataset**:  Randomized trial of 475 men treated with high- vs. low-dose diethylstilbestrol (DES) for advanced prostate cancer

**Objective** To evaluate treatment effect heterogeneity and guide individualized therapy decisions using risk-adaptive modeling

**Methods**
Semi-parametric Cox proportional hazards models with treatment–covariate interactions

Causal inference via potential outcomes framework to estimate individualized treatment effects (ITEs)

Continuous effect modification analysis using tumor size and patient age
Delta Method to estimate the variance of ITE to enable confidence interval construction.

**Result**: High-dose DES was not beneficial on average (HR = 0.851; p = 0.519)
Significant effect modification: patients with large tumors benefited (interaction HR = 0.691; p = 0.005), while patients over 70 faced increased risk (interaction HR = 1.064; p < 0.001)

Visualizations of patient-specific hazard ratios supported precision treatment strategies which existing studies could not address.

**Dataset**: Clinical records from 299 heart failure patients (Faisalabad Institute of Cardiology & Allied Hospital, Pakistan)  
**Objective** To identify key predictors of survival in heart failure patients and explore clinical mediation pathways.

**Methods**

Supervised learning: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine (SVM)

Penalized regression: LASSO, Ridge, Elastic Net

Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) for mediation analysis of prognostic variables

**Result**: Ejection fraction, serum sodium, and serum creatinine were consistently identified as the strongest survival predictors. Models achieved high AUC and specificity, with interpretable results supporting data-informed clinical decision-making.

 *Censored Survival Time Estimation Using EM Algorithm*  
**Affiliation**: Dept. of Statistics, Western Michigan University | Aug 2024 – Present  
**Dataset**: Motorette lifespan data (Schnee & Hahn, 1979)  
**Purpose**: To explore statistical modeling strategies for analyzing censored time-to-event data  
**Methods**:  
- Leveraged the power of Expectation–Maximization (EM) algorithm to estimate patients' interval censored survival time.
- Kaplan–Meier and parametric survival modeling (visuals)

**Result**: EM algorithm demonstrated strong performance in recovering latent survival distribution under random censoring. Insights were applied to inform experimental design strategies in clinical trials.

 *Clinical Epidemiology Project: Alzheimer’s Disease Subgroup Analysis *  

**Affiliation**: Summer Research, Western Michigan University | Jun 2024 – Aug 2024  
**Dataset**: ACTC Solanezumab Preclinical Trial Data  
**Purpose**: To assess subgroup-specific treatment effects and identify cognitive decline risk factors  
**Methods**:  
- Regression modeling on MMSE and ARIA endpoints  
- Subgroup analyses by APOE4 status, centiloid level, education, and BMI

**Result**: Found that surrogate endpoint selection (MMSE vs. ARIA) influences identified risk profiles. APOE4 status and centiloid level showed consistent association with AD progression across subgroups.

 **Evaluating the Effectiveness of HAART Regimens on CD4 Cell Count Trajectories in HIV-Infected Women**  
**Affiliation**: Final Project, Western Michigan University | Jan 2024 – Apr 2024  
**Dataset**: Women’s Interagency HIV Study (WIHS), 274 HIV-positive women observed over 9 visits across 54 months  
**Purpose**: To assess the impact of HAART regimen type on immune restoration (CD4 cell count) and investigate subgroup-specific treatment responses  
**Methods**:  
- Regression modeling on log-transformed CD4 counts at last visit using OLS  
- Longitudinal analysis using GLS and linear mixed-effects models  
- Subgroup effect estimation using interaction terms (age, IDU, alcohol, smoking)  

**Results**: Monotherapy and Triple therapy were associated with higher CD4 restoration than Dual therapy, especially among women with injection drug use. The interaction effects revealed that treatment effectiveness varied significantly across subgroups, notably IDU and smoking status. CD4 improvement trajectories declined over time for all regimens, with Monotherapy and Triple therapy showing slower decline rates. These findings emphasize the importance of personalized HAART strategies based on behavioral and clinical profiles.

**[2. Methodological Comparison of Longitudinal Models for HAART Data: Addressing Small Sample Sizes and Unbalanced Designs -*Pending*](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1bMr6XSYoqPTzmEmTaCPri5JieLxC9Wu0/view?usp=sharing)**

 **Methodological Comparison of Longitudinal Models for HAART Data: Addressing Small Sample Sizes and Unbalaned Designs **  
**Affiliation**: Final Project, Western Michigan University | Jan 2024 – Apr 2024  
**Dataset**: Simulated and real data from the WIHS cohort (274 HIV-positive women followed over 54 months with CD4 counts recorded at 9 visits)  
**Purpose**: To compare the performance of LME, GEE, and GLMM in estimating HAART treatment effects under small sample sizes and unbalanced longitudinal designs  
**Methods**:  
- Applied LME, GEE, and GLMM to subsets of longitudinal data  
- Evaluated statistical power, estimation accuracy, and computational efficiency  
- Modeled interaction effects (e.g., treatment × time, treatment × IDU, treatment × smoking) across simulated sample sizes (n = 10, 20, 50, 100, 200)  

**Result**: GLMM demonstrated superior accuracy and robustness across varying sample sizes, especially with non-normal outcomes. LME and GEE yielded comparable estimates at larger sample sizes, but diverged under smaller or unbalanced conditions. Interaction terms such as HAART × IDU and HAART × smoking status significantly influenced CD4 trajectories. Results guide model choice in HIV studies based on data characteristics, with GLMM preferred when flexibility and subject-level effects are key.
